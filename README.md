# Developed a visually engaging and interactive portfolio website using React(fully responsive for mobile view)
showcasing myskills, projects, and achievements. Implemented interactive design principles to enhance user engagement and accessibility.

## Key Features:
Utilized React components and state management to create a modular and maintainable codebase, improving development
efficiency and scalability.

Designed a visually appealing user interface using modern CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material UI, resulting in an
intuitive and seamless navigation experience.

Implemented smooth animations and transitions to enhance the website's interactivity, capturing users' attention and
creating a memorable browsing experience.

Implemented form handling and contact functionality, allowing visitors to easily get in touch, increasing potential
opportunities for collaboration or employment.

This React portfolio website not only demonstrates my technical proficiency in front-end development but also showcases my
creativity, attention to detail, and ability to create an exceptional user experience. It effectively represents my skills and
accomplishments, making it an impactful tool for professional networking and career advancement.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
